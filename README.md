# Trajectory-User Linking using Higher-order Mobility Flow Representation

This repository contains an implementation of Trajectory-User Linking using Higher-order Mobility Flow Representation. The goal of this project is to link trajectories of individuals to their corresponding user profiles by leveraging higher-order mobility flow representation. The work has been accepted and will be presented at the International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM) 2023.
